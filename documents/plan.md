# Project plan

## Language evaluation
I will know my language has accomplished its goals when I can write some
chiptune music, and I am confident that it is being created correctly.  I will
try to recreate some early video game music that I can find scores for to make
sure my DSL is accurately creating music.  Since I am unfamiliar with chiptune
music creation, I will use my happiness with the interface as one test of its
quality.  I will also try to find some other people to test the interface to see
how easy to use it is.

## Implementation plan
I think I can find a host language pretty quickly.  I plan on making the syntax
for the DSL simple and well-specified, so any language should be able to parse
it without complicated parsing tools.  I think it will take a while to learn how
computers make sounds and to properly control sound generation with my host
language.  I think the parsing should be fairly simple.

I plan to have the following:

November 8  - Language choice/possible sound generation

November 15 - Full sound generation

November 22 - Beginning syntax layout

November 23 - Prototype: Examples of syntax prepared and some (possibly written
              in host language) demos of what generated music will sound like.
              
November 29 - Full syntax and example music

December 1  - Preliminary Evaluation: Evaluate where I'm at and write it up.
              Provide some examples of music written in my DSL and demo them.
              
December 6  - Finalize.  Create more final demos of the DSL and clean up any
              ragged edges.
              
December 12 - Final write-up: Write up language.  Provide finished examples.

December 18 - Provide demo - play some music and show off the syntax.  Maybe
              write some music live to show what that looks like.
