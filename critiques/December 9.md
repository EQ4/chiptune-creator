###Nick's Critique:

Your program is looking pretty cool to me. It sounds great that you have been able to get your compiler and parser working. 
The multiple staves question sounds interesting too. 
It sounds like in terms of future direction you might consider extending stave and part
support further. Could you see this as an arrangement or compositional aid at some point in the future? Would a use
case of an orchestra composer wanting to use your package make sense at some point? Or someone just wanting to 
express a full band orchestration in your language? It seems like this will not make very much of an
impact on the other use cases of your language, as I understand them, if implemented carefully. So, 
this is definitly something to consider as you move forward in the language.

As you move forward, it would also likely be interesting to experiment with input methods. Is code, exclusively,
really the best way to express your language? Or could there be some form of interface that allows you to take 
full advantage of the reusability of code but the natural musical input of a piano or other input device?

Also, it would be interesting to support basic musical operators like transpositions and key changes. If I am not mistaken,
at the moment it is necessary for you to rewrite any section that you would like to change only slightly. Being able
to apply basic changes to the notes you are working with could make this easier and more fun to work with.

It sounds like you are at a cool place with this project already and I really am looking forward to seeing your demo.
