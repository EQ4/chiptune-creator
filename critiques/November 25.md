Your project is very cool! I think that it would be cool to have an easy and intuitive 
way to write 8-bit music with a DSL. It is definitely a domain that I am not very
familiar with, but the implementation for the language looks good so far! A visual representation
would be cool, but I also do not know how difficult that would be to implement. Not being familiar
with this domain at all, the only questions I really have are about the input from the user. I
looked at the example file and it seems like the sytax is repetetive and unintuitive. I don't know 
if you have plans to change this or if functions like Chord and Section would just be something
that the user needs to learn how to use? Anyway, I think the idea is super cool and you have made 
great progress so far.
