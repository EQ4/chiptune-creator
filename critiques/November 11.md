#### Pressing Issues

I definitely agree with you, figuring out the libraries and what already exists are probably the most pressing tasks. I like the change you made to the code, from what you found during class. It really cleaned everything up. Now, you just need to figure out how to export that to MIDI. I'd also like to see if you could convert MIDI to MP3 with some Scala library, instead of using the LAME encoder. 

I'd also say you should think about what the input and IR are going to look like. Will the input just be a list of notes, which are parsed into the IR and played? Is your target audience musicians or coders? This might change what the input looks like.

Also, Go would have been really cool. I haven't used Go personally, but I've read a lot about it and it's a nifty language.

#### Question(s) for me

For me, I would love to see something that simplifies input to the program. I want to be able to create music with as little input as possible. I'm not really sure how much things can be simplified, since you have to enter all notes at some point. One idea, which is something I do, is using variables to represent a sequence of notes, and you could use that variable in your parse.

#### Final Thoughts

Thanks for the summary! I liked that as an addition.
