##### Pressing Issues
I know there are programs that let you create music and even make it 8-bit in style with enough know-how.
I'm curious about how exactly this project will make this easier/more fun/more expansive.

##### Question(s) for me
This project sounds very intriguing to me. I have played the clarinet for many years and really
enjoy music, including the 8-bit sounds of yore. I am excited to play with it when you are done!
The scope seems reasoable, but I have very little knowledge in this area.

##### Final Thoughts
For my benefit (I'll also do this soon), it would be nice if you had a document giving a concise summary of
what your project will do/accomplish. This will certainly let me give more insightful comments and
may focus your gaze.
Best of Luck!
